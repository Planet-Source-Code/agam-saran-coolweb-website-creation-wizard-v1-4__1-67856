PLEASE LEAVE A COMMENT AT PLANET-SOURCE-CODE!
If you like CoolWeb and think it could be useful then please drop a line at Planet-Source-Code. It would encourage me to develop it further and make it even better. A vote would also be nice to rank CoolWeb higher, it will take only a minute or so. I will be very thankful to you for this.




Before You Run
-------------------------------------------------------------
1. Install WebShot, download it from http://www.websitescreenshots.com/. CoolTemplates uses it to capture screenshots of templates you create. If you do not want this feature then just click Cancel when are asked to select "webshotcmd.exe". You can later specify the location of WebShot throught the About dialog.

2. Compile CoolWeb and run it. You must run CoolWeb at least once.

3. Do not delete the empty "Sample" folder in the CoolTemplates directory.

4. There is a Flash demo that shows how to create the "Grassy" template. Find it in the "Demo" folder of this directory.



Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------
CoolTemplates enables you to create working templates for CoolWeb. With CoolTemplates creating templates for CoolWeb is quite easy. CoolTemplates is designed to be as precise as it could be, and it tries to visually automate the procedure of creating templates.
It is also designed to be easy. As with CoolWeb, using CoolTemplates is also truly visual! 
It creates all necessary files and folders, places their content and capture screenshots of your template. Be sure the code of your template is valid HTML or else CoolTemplates won't work correctly.



What CoolTemplates does for you?
-------------------------------------------------------------
1. Creates the template folder in the CoolWeb "templates" directory.

3. Makes the procedure of placing comments and creating "menuitem.txt" as easy as it could be.

4. Automatically copies all related files to your template's directory.

5. Makes necessary changes to the HTML code, so that all files all taken from "files" folder.
For Example:
	<img src="images/mypic.jpg"> and <img src="mypic.jpg">
turns to:
	<img src="files/mypic.jpg">

6. Makes necessary changes to all the stylesheets, so that all files all taken from the same folder the stylesheet is placed in ("files").
